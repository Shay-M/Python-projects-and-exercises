    "### 1. the `re` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use the `re` module in python, one need first to import it. <br/>\n",
    "As mentioned in the lecture, there are 3 main use cases:\n",
    "1. Find - mainly using `search` and `findall` functions.\n",
    "2. Replace - mainly using the `sub` function.\n",
    "3. Split -  using the `split` function.\n",
    "4. Match object - this is not a use case, but an object returned mainly by \"find\" functions and can be used for further text manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax to search for a match in a string is this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "match = re.search(pattern, text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `pattern` is the regular expression, `text` is the text that the regular expression is applied to. <br/>\n",
    "Match holds the search result that matches the string in an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`search()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search) returns only the first occurrence of a match, in contrast, [`findall()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall) returns all matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful function is [`split()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.split), which splits a string based on a regex pattern â€“ we'll use all of these functions and others where appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mostly, we'll use search to learn about the syntax, but sometimes we'll use split instead of search to explain a pattern. <br/>\n",
    "There are other functions which we'll use later."
